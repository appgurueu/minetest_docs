= Modchannels

Allows server side mods (SSMs) communication to client side mods (CSMs) and vice versa.

== Server Side API

=== Functions

==== minetest.mod_channel_join(channel_name)

* `channel_name`: string, modchannel name

Returns an object for use with <<Methods>>. Creates the channel if it does not exist and joins the channel.

==== minetest.register_on_modchannel_message(function(channel_name, sender, message))

* `channel_name`: string, modchannel name (already joined)
* `sender`: string, empty if from a SSM, player name if from a client
* `message`: string, message

Used for handling messages received from the client.

=== Methods

NOTE: `channel` here means the object returned by `minetest.mod_channel_join`.

==== channel:leave()

The server will leave the channel, meaning no more messages from this channel on `minetest.register_on_modchannel_message`

TIP: Set the channel to `nil` afterwords to free resources

==== channel:is_writeable()

* Returns `bool`: `true` true if the channel is writeable, `false` if it's not.

==== channel:send_all(message)

* `message`: string, limited to 65535 bytes

Sends to all SSMs and CSMs on the channel.

CAUTION: The message will not if channel is not writable or invalid.
